# Hex Map World Generation

A procedural world generation system using hexagonal tiles with realistic geological and hydrological simulation.

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive world generation pipeline that creates realistic terrains, climate systems, hydrology, and biomes using scientifically-based models. The system supports both world-scale generation (with toroidal wrapping) and regional maps (bounded areas).

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed Deliverables

#### HEX-001: Hex Grid Foundation
- **Axial coordinate system** with efficient neighbor lookups
- **Dual topology support**: World maps (toroidal) and Region maps (bounded)
- **Coordinate conversions**: Axial â†” Offset â†” Pixel
- **Distance calculations** with shortest path for world maps
- **Comprehensive test coverage**: 18 tests, 100% passing

## Quick Start

### Build and Test
```bash
# Clone and build
git clone <repository>
cd hex-map
go build ./cmd/hex-world

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Demo the coordinate system
./hex-world demo-coords --size=20x20 --topology=world
./hex-world demo-distance --from=0,0 --to=9,0 --topology=world
```

### Features

#### Coordinate System
- **Flat-top hexagons** with 10km center-to-center spacing
- **Axial coordinates** for efficient computation
- **Topology awareness**: World vs Region behavior

#### Dual Topology Support
- **World Maps**: Toroidal wrapping where edges connect
  - All hexes have exactly 6 neighbors
  - Shortest path calculations consider wrapping
  - Perfect for planet-scale generation
- **Region Maps**: Bounded areas with edge effects
  - Edge hexes have 2-5 neighbors  
  - Natural boundaries for continental/island generation
